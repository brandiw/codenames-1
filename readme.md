# **Codenames Rules**
_Adapted from [official instructions.](https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf)_

## Game overview
Each game requires a minimum of 4 players. Each team will choose a spymaster and the remaining players will be the field operatives.
The starting team is randomly determined. They will have 9 words to guess and will give the first clue of the game.
The opposing team will have 8 cards to guess.
Only the spymasters for each team will know the secret identities of the 25 agents. This can be activated by toggling between player & spymaster view. Their teammates only know the agents by their codenames.
Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue can relate to multiple words on the board. The field operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. The first team to contact all their agents win the game.
## Giving a clue
If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue that relates to the codenames your team is trying to guess.
You clue must only be ONE WORD followed by how many codenames are related to your clue. Double check to ensure your clue doesn't relate to the assassin codename.
_Example: Two of your words are NUT and BARK. Both of these grow on trees, so you say tree: 2._
## Making contact
When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to figure out what it means. They can debate amongst themselves.
Field operatives indicate their official guess by clicking on one of the codenames.
- If the field operative selects a card belonging to his/her team, they get another guess.
- If the field operatives selects an innocent bystander or card belonging to the other team, this ends their turn
- If the field operative selects the assassin. This ends the game! The team that contacted the assassin loses.
The field operatives must always make at least one guess. Any wrong guesses ends the turn immediately. If the field operative guesses correctly, they can keep guessing.
_Example: Red team's first clue was tree, 2. The red opeartive wanted to guess ORANGE and NUT. ORANGE was an innocent bystander and red's turn ends. On the next turn, the red spymaster's clue is river, 3. The red team selects AMAZON, BED and she's unsure of the third river word. Instead she selects NUT from the previous turn's clue. NUT is correct. Red team got 3 guesses correct, red team is allowed one extra final guess. They can attempt the third river word or second tree word._
## Ending the game
The game ends when one team has guessed all their words correctly. Alternately, a game can end early if a field operative makes contact with the assassin.
